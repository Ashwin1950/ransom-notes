### Selected Problem - 4: ###

Viji heads the forensic investigation department of the Chennai police. Recently there has been a big increase in the number of kidnappings. The kidnapper keeps leaving ransom notes. These ransom notes are all words cut from different pages. Viji suspects that the kidnapper is cutting all of these from a single magazine only. If she can find out which magazine the kidnapper is using, it might help her to catch the criminal. Help her.

a. Create a system where Viji will be able to type or copy and paste a large
amount of text. These would be all the words that appear in that magazine.

b. Viji will then put in the words that are there in the ransom note also.

c. The system should tell whether the kidnapper could have written that note from the initial text input i.e., the magazine.

d. If the words are not present or not sufficient, the system should be able to point out the total number of words that do not exist in the first input
comparing to the second input and also list out the missing words.
